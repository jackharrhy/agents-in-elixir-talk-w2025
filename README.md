talk given during [gdg st. john's 2025](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-st-johns/)

this repo contains the (vibe coded for the sake of illustrating the talk) code shown during the talk

i did a recording of me giving the talk on my computer later the same day for those who missed attending in person (and also less time on the preamble, more on elixir, since my talk ran long...):
